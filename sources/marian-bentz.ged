2 CONT DANIEL McCOMAS by sisters Mary Mortimeyer in Murray Utah and
2 CONC Frances Revez in Park Ridge, Illinois:
2 CONT Daniel McComas was a tailor.  Just when he came to Maryland in
2 CONC uncertain.  He first purchased land in 1692, but being a tailor,
2 CONC he may have set up a shop and living quarters for some time
2 CONC before that date.  He located in Anne Arundel Counth, Maryland
2 CONC near what is now Annapolis.
2 CONT By March 16, 1692, Daniel had security for 4000 pounds of
2 CONC tobacco and on August 4, 1692, he bought 98 acres of land called
2 CONC Brownes Chance from Thomas Browne.  The price was "4000 pounds
2 CONC Good Sound Merchantable Tobacco in Casks)."  Daniel's name is
2 CONC spelled Mchcomas in the deed.
2 CONT Thomas Browne obtained this land by patent dated October 1,
2 CONC 1687, assigned to hom by Richard Beard.  The98 acres of land,
2 CONC "more or less", ws on the south side of Anne Arundel orSevern
2 CONC River beginning at a bounded white oak in Richard Wharfield's
2 CONC line to a red oak in Johas Pierpoint's line to a white oak of
2 CONC Edward Gardner's.  There was a house already built and other
2 CONC edifices.  This deed was not recorded until March 29, 1705/6.
2 CONC Daniel had been dead six or seven years by that date.  Perhaps,
2 CONC the deed was recorded whenit was presented to the court by his
2 CONC eldest son, John, at the age of eighteen.
2 CONT Daniel McComas was married to Elizabeth.  On October 17, 1699.
2 CONC Elizabeth was a widow when she appreared in court to have a deed
2 CONC of intend recorded.  She declared that she and Daniel had four
2 CONC sons, gave their names and birth dates and stated that Daniel,
2 CONC in case of his death, did not want his sons bount out to
2 CONC servitude longer than their eighteenthbirthdays.  Elizabeth
2 CONC agreed, exept, in case of her death, she did not want he sons
2 CONC bount out longer rthatn their sixteenth birthdays.  
2 CONT Elizabeth made her mark.
2 CONT We found o  the court date April 9, 1700, appraisers John
2 CONC Mariott and Nicholas Sheppard presenteed the inventory of Daniel
2 CONC McComas' estate.  Listed are two pirs of tailor's shears and an
2 CONC old tailor's goose, but no fabric.  Perhaps, he no  longer
2 CONC pliedhis trade after he boughthis land.  He owned a small amount
2 CONC of livestock, but a hammer and broad axe were the only tools he
2 CONC possessed.  Household goods made up most of the inventory ane it
2 CONC was valued atr aboutone-fourth of his entire extate of 22
2 CONC pounds, nine shillings and four pence.  
2 CONT Daniel was probable in his early 30's when he died and was just
2 CONC beginning to get a good foundation established for rearing his
2 CONC family.  
2 CONT A bulletine of April 1925 (?) lists orphans of Anne Arundel
2 CONC County, Maryland, referring to Liber T.B.1.  Daniel's and
2 CONC Elizabeth's sons were listed and also listed with them was
2 CONC Ellinor Macomis.  Ellinor must be considered their sisster.
2 CONC Sons John, Alexander and Daniel  were placed with Stephen Gill.
2 CONC Ellinor was placed with William Stephens.  William was placed
2 CONC with John Warfield.  (Note: Daniel McComas' land adjoined
2 CONC Richard Wharfield's.)  `
2 CONT Strong proof appearedthroughout our research of widow Elizabeth
2 CONC McComas mrrying Stephen Gill, but no mrriage record could be
2 CONC found.  HenryClay McComas mentioned a court record reading April
2 CONC 9, 1700, Came Stephen Gill Administrtor of Daniel Maccomus
2 CONC deceased--.  He gave no reference for the court record and these
2 CONC researchers could not find it.  The practice at that time was to
2 CONC appoint the widow administratrix, but, if she remarried, the new
2 CONC husbnd automatically becme administrator or co-administrator of
2 CONC the deceased's estate.  When Elizabeth, at age 30 to 33, wed
2 CONC Stephen Gill, why would she permit her children Ellinor and
2 CONC William to be placed with others?
2 CONT On Maryland Rent Rolls of 1707, Stephen Gill was listed as
2 CONC possessor for Daniel McComas of "Brownes Chance".

2 CONT I am living alone over here in the Shennandoah Vlley but lke the

2 CONT You asked about the McComas massacre.  It occurred in 1883,
2 CONC whjen Judge H. C. McComas (my uncle) and his wife Junita, with
2 CONC their youngest son, Charles, were enroute to some silver mines,
2 CONC near Silver City, New Mexico, they rn into a bank of Apches
2 CONC under Chief Geronimo, and were massacred.  For some time it was
2 CONC believed that Charles, who was six year old, was living.  My
2 CONC mother spent much time in corresponding with variousparties, and
2 CONC was at last convienced that the Indians in trying to get away
2 CONC from the U. S. Army pursurers, killed Chrlie by dashing out his
2 CONC brains and throwing his body iunto a canyon. Gen., George Crooks
2 CONC led the U. S. Army men in chase, and finally Geronimo and a
2 CONC number of his band wre captured.  He was confined in a fort in
2 CONC Floriday (I believe) and lived to be a very old Indian.  I saw
2 CONC him when he was brought to the Worlds Fair in Chicago.  This was
2 CONC the last time the Apaches went on the warpath.  At the time
2 CONC Uncle Ham and Aunt Junie were killed, they were living in St.
2 CONC Louis.  Uncle Ham was a lawyer by profession but had interests
2 CONC in silver mines in New Mexico.
2 CONT Uncle Ham was born Nov. 9, 1831 in Cabell Co. W. Va. He ws
2 CONC admitted to the bar when 21 years old.  He enlisted when only 17
2 CONC in the Mexican War in the company of E. W. McComas (our uncle
2 CONC Lish), He went, when young, to Monticello,Ill., where he
2 CONC practice law for several years.  He was a Colonel in the U. S.
2 CONC Army during the Civil war, and was the only one of the family to
2 CONC beome a Union man.  He married twice and at the time of his
2 CONC death had five children living; David, William, Mary, Ada, and
2 CONC little Charlie who was taken by ytheIndians.  There is the
2 CONC barest possibility that Charlie was not killed but despite many
2 CONC disturbing reports, which were all threshed out by mother and
2 CONC the family, they concluded at last that he did not survive,  He
2 CONC was born the same week I was, and the same year.  He would be 69
2 CONC years old if living."
2 CONT ...I trust this answers all the questions which Lucille
2 CONC presented.  Martin is likely now on his way home from Japan, and
2 CONC I hopeto have the Vorbergs with me for Christmas.  Mack was a

2 CONC in Giles. Co., and later of Cabell Co., W. Va.  Only the more
